NAME
    Dancer::Layout::Bootstrap - Boostrap layout for Dancer

SYNOPSIS
      # 1. Copy the included template files to your dancer application
      # 2. Change the "layout" parameter in config.yml to "bootstrap"
      # 3. Dance On!

      # Preview the layout
      perl -Ilib -w bin\app.pl

ABSTRACT
    Template and dummy application that applies the Bootstrap CSS to Dancer.

SUPPORTED FEATURES
    If you want to show alerts etc., the main template already provides
    support for that via Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage.

        flash success => sprintf "Welcome back, %s",
            session('user')->{name};

    ... will produce a nice, green "Welcome back" message for the user.

    All flash message output is HTML escaped for security reasons.

NEEDED MODULES
    The simple templating included with Dancer does not properly support
    user log-in / log out, so the template needs Template::Toolkit.
